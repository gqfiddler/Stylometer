nip it in the bud

no love lost
no pain, no gain
no skin off my back
no stone unturned
no time like the present
over spilled milk
nose to the grindstone
not a hope in hell
not a minute's peace
not playing with a full deck
not the end of the world
not in my backyard
not written in stone
nothing to sneeze at
nothing ventured nothing gained
now we're cooking
off the top of my head
off the wagon
off the wall
older than dirt
older than Methuselah
old hat
on a roll
on cloud nine
high horse
pins and needles
on the bandwagon
on the money
on the nose
on the tip of my tongue
on thin ice
once bitten, twice shy
a bad apple
one born every minute
one foot in the grave
one in a million
one red cent
only game in town
can of worms
the flood gates
the floodgates
over the hump
out of sight, out of mind
out of the frying pan into the fire
out of the woods
out on a limb
over a barrel
pain and suffering
panic button
par for the course
part and parcel
pass the buck
patience is a virtue
penny pincher
perfect storm
pig in a poke
pile it on
pillar of the community
pin your hopes on
pitter patter of little feet
plain as day
plain as the nose on your face
play by the rules
play your cards right
playing the field
playing with fire
pleased as punch
plenty of fish in the sea
pot calling the kettle black
pull a fast one
pulling the wool over their eyes
pulling your leg
pedal to the metal
cart before the horse
best foot forward
quick as a lick
quick as a wink
quick as lightning
quiet as a dormouse
rags to riches
raining buckets
raining cats and dogs
rank and file
reap what you sow
red as a beet
red herring
reinvent the wheel
rich and famous
rings a bell
ripped me off
rise and shine
road to hell is paved with good intentions
rob Peter to pay Paul
roll over in the grave
running in circles
salt of the earth
scared out of his wits
scared out of her wits
scared stiff
scared to death
sealed with a kiss
second to none
see eye to eye
seen the light
seize the day
set the record straight
set your teeth on edge
sharp as a tack
shoot the breeze
shoot for the moon
shot in the dark
shoulder to the wheel
sick as a dog
sigh of relief
signed, sealed, and delivered
sink or swim
six of one, half a dozen of another
skating on thin ice
slept like a log
slinging mud
slippery as an eel
slow as molasses in January
smooth as a baby's bottom
snug as a bug in a rug
sow his wild oats
spare the rod, spoil the child
speak of the devil
spilled the beans
spinning your wheels
spitting image of
spoke with relish
spring to life
stands out like a sore thumb
squeaky wheel gets the grease
start from scratch
stick in the mud
still waters run deep
stitch in time
stop and smell the roses
straw that broke the camel's back
strong as an ox
stubborn as a mule
stuff that dreams are made of
stuffed shirt
sweating blood
sweating bullets
take a load off
take one for the team
take the bait
take the bull by the horns
take the plunge
takes one to know one
takes two to tango
the more the merrier
the real deal
the real McCoy
the red carpet treatment
the same old story
no accounting for taste
thick as a brick
thick as thieves
think outside of the box
third time's the charm
this day and age
this hurts me worse than it hurts you
this point in time
three sheets to the wind
three strikes against him/her
throw in the towel
tie one on
tighter than a drum
time and time again
time is of the essence
tip of the iceberg
to each his own
to the best of my knowledge
toe the line
tongue-in-cheek
too good to be true
too hot to handle
too numerous to mention
touch with a ten foot pole
tough as nails
turn over a new leaf
turned over a new leaf
trials and tribulations
tried and true
trip down memory lane
twist of fate
two cents worth
two peas in a pod
ugly as sin
under his thumb
under her thumb
under the counter
under the gun
under the same roof
till the cows come home
up the creek
uphill battle
upper crust
upset the applecart
vain attempt
vain effort
vanquish the enemy
vested interest
for the other shoe to drop
wakeup call
warm welcome
watching the clock
watch your p's and q's
watch your tongue
water under the bridge
weather the storm
went belly up
wet behind the ears
weed them out
week of Sundays
what goes around comes around
what you see is what you get
when it rains, it pours
when push comes to shove
when the cat's away
when the going gets tough, the tough get going
white as a sheet
whole ball of wax
whole hog
whole nine yards
wild goose chase
wonders never cease
wisdom of the ages
wolf at the door
words fail me
work like a dog
world-weary
worst nightmare
wrong side of the bed
yanking your chain
you are what you eat
you can run, but you can't hide
you only live once
young and foolish
young and vibrant
young and naive
