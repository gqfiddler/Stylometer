'''
Contains the following functions for comparing data:

readVectors: reads a list of vectors from a csv file

standardizeVector: z-score standardizes a vector of text metrics to the data
table of exemplary writing in the specified genre

findClosest: finds the three most similar authors to a submission

makeRecommendations: analyzes a submission and generates a paragraph of recommendations
for improvement

dendroPlot: generates a dendrogram from a list of vectors & 64-byte encodes it

displayDendro: plots and shows a dendogram from a list of vectors
